{"role":"assistant","text":"Your architecture is a simple, monolithic setup with two services: paymen and service. The dependency between them is via gRPC protocol, which suggests that they are tightly coupled. The main bottleneck in this architecture is likely the tight coupling between these services, making it difficult to evolve or maintain independently. To improve this architecture, consider breaking down the services into more domain-focused components, such as separate datastores and clearer boundaries.","ts":1765089888,"source":"llm","user_id":"demo-user"}

{"role":"assistant","text":"Based on the provided signals, I recommend using 4 instances of a gRPC-enabled service with 2 vCPUs each and approximately 8GB RAM per instance to handle the average RPS of 200 and peak RPS of 100.

{"role":"assistant","text":"Based on the provided signals, I recommend 4 instances of the service with 2 vCPU each and approximately 8GB RAM per instance to handle the average RPS of 200 and peak RPS of 100.

{"role":"user","text":"Okey thank you","ts":1765387515,"source":"user","user_id":"demo-user"}
{"role":"assistant","text":"Based on the provided signals, I recommend a single instance of service with 2 vCPUs and sufficient RAM to handle the average RPS (200) and peak RPS (100). The burst factor is relatively low at 2, which suggests that the system can handle short-term spikes in traffic. The latency P95 is 95ms, which indicates that the system should be designed for low-latency processing. Given the gRPC dependency from paymen to service, I suggest using a single instance of service with sufficient resources to handle the expected load.","ts":1765387562,"source":"llm","user_id":"demo-user"}
