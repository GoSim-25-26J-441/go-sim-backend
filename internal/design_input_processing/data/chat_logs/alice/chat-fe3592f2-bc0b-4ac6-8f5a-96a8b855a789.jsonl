{"role":"assistant","text":"Your architecture is a simple, monolithic setup with two services: paymen and service. The dependency between them is via gRPC protocol, which suggests that they are tightly coupled. The main bottleneck in this architecture is likely the tight coupling between these services, making it difficult to evolve or maintain independently. To improve this architecture, consider breaking down the services into more domain-focused components, such as separate datastores and clearer boundaries.","ts":1765090640,"source":"llm","user_id":"alice"}
