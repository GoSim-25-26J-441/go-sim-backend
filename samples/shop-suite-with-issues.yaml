expect_issues:
  - cycle(auth-service, user-service, billing-service)
  - shared-db(catalog-service, search-service, shared-catalog-db)
  - god-service(api-gateway)
  - chatty(order-service -> catalog-service)
  - cross-db-read(user-service -> orders-db)
  - redundant(email-service vs notification-service)
